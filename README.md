# Battle Cats Save File Editor

I have a discord server:https://discord.gg/DvmMgvn5ZB You can become a developer there and give me your pre-backed up save files
and is the best way to report bugs + contact me.

Thanks to:

Lethal's editor for giving me inspiration to start the project and it helped me work out how to patch the save data and edit cf/xp and I used it to figure out how to upload saves onto the ponos servers: https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleCatsCheats/comments/djehhn/editoren/

Beeven and csehydrogen's open source code, which helped me figure out how to patch save data: https://github.com/beeven/battlecats, https://github.com/csehydrogen/BattleCatsHacker

# How to use
This got way more complicated due to added security to the transfer system, you now need to have a rooted device - either emulator or real and extract the save that way. 

Download the tool https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor/releases (get Battle Cats Save File Editor.zip, not the exe)

I have created a tutorial video that goes you through the steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2f68SyH1Jo

:exclamation::exclamation:IMPORTANT:When you are done make sure to either select the patch save option or click "yes" when the dialog box opens asking you if you're finished with the editor

Run BackupManagerEN and restore the save or overwrite the save in the game's files

Take those codes and put them back into the game

And done have fun!
