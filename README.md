### Preface

Real quick, before we jump into the things made by the great [fieryhenry](https://github.com/fieryhenry) (thanks for this great program!), I'd like to explain my part in this.

I'm purely just here to rewrite the C# code into Python, and once I'm done with that, I'll make a GUI. My name's [MCMi460](https://github.com/MCMi460), and thank you for checking me out.

Also, a HUGE thank you to [!j0](https://github.com/j0912345) for helping me out with patching the save file!

# Battle Cats Save File Editor

# How to use
## Warning: <b>Before editing anything, please make sure to create a backup of the save file somewhere, in case things go wrong</b>

This got way more complicated due to added security to the transfer system, you now need to have a rooted device - either emulator or real and extract the save that way.

Download the tool https://github.com/MCMi460/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor/releases (get Battle Cats Save File Editor.zip, not the exe)
