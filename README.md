# Battle Cats Save File Editor

I have a discord server:https://discord.gg/DvmMgvn5ZB You can become a developer there and give me your pre-backed up save files
and is the best way to report bugs + contact me

# How to use
This got way more complicated due to added security to the transfer system, you now need to have a rooted device - either emulator or real and extract the save that way
I have created a tutorial video that goes you through the steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2f68SyH1Jo
:exclamation::exclamation:IMPORTANT:When you are done make sure to either select the patch save option or click "yes" when the dialog box opens asking you if you're finished with the editor
Run BackupManagerEN and restore the save
Take those codes and put them back into the game
And done have fun!

If you want to support my work and keep me motivated to continue to work on this project then maybe consider gifting me some ko-fi:https://ko-fi.com/fieryhenry obviously it's entirely optional and I will keep this editor free to use forever and only donate if you have some spare money and are willing to use it supporting me.
