# BattleCatsSaveFileEditor

To edit your save file first download u/1plus1equalswindow's save file editor https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleCatsCheats/comments/djehhn/editoren/

Back up your save using BackupManagerEN.exe and rename the save file to save
Replace the file named save in my save editor with your save

Run my save editor
Do what you want with it and close it

Place the edited save in the saves folder that u/1plus1equalswindow's editor made
Run the BackupManagerEN and restore the save
Put the codes in u/1plus1equalswindow's EditorEN and choose the last option
Take those codes and put them back into the game

We have to do this so the save files can be patched otherwise the game won't recognise them
And done have fun!
