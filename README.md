# Battle Cats Save File Editor

I have a discord server:https://discord.gg/DvmMgvn5ZB You can become a developer there and give me your pre-backed up save files
and is the best way to report bugs + contact me.

Thanks to:

Lethal's editor for giving me inspiration to start the project and it helped me work out how to patch the save data and edit cf/xp and I used it to figure out how to upload saves onto the ponos servers: https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleCatsCheats/comments/djehhn/editoren/

Beeven and csehydrogen's open source code, which helped me figure out how to patch save data: https://github.com/beeven/battlecats, https://github.com/csehydrogen/BattleCatsHacker

# How to use
This got way more complicated due to added security to the transfer system, you now need to have a rooted device - either emulator or real and extract the save that way. 

Download the tool https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor/releases (get Battle Cats Save File Editor.zip, not the exe)

I have created an updated tutorial video that goes you through the steps: https://youtu.be/D6hPnJTlq-U
