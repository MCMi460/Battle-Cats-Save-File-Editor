# Battle Cats Save File Editor

I have a discord server:https://discord.gg/nPPuw3C7gp You can become a developer there and give me your pre-backed up save files
and is the best way to report bugs + contact me

To edit your save file first download u/1plus1equalswindow's (aka Lethal's)save file editor https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleCatsCheats/comments/djehhn/editoren/

Back up your save using BackupManagerEN.exe

Unzip downloadthis.zip from the latest release https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor/releases/latest

Run the editor

Locate to your save generated by the backup manager (it will be located in the saves folder) a dialog browse window should pop-up (or type in the path to your save if using the NoUpdate version)

:exclamation::exclamation:IMPORTANT:When you are done make sure to either select the patch save option or click "yes" when the dialog box opens asking you if you're finished with the editor

Run BackupManagerEN and restore the save


Take those codes and put them back into the game

And done have fun!


If you want to support my work and keep me motivated to continue to work on this project then maybe consider gifting me some ko-fi:https://ko-fi.com/fieryhenry obviously it's entirely optional and I will keep this editor free to use forever and only donate if you have some spare money and are willing to use it supporting me.
